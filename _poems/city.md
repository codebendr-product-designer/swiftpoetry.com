    city

    do {
        try escaping(the.city)
        
    } catch some.breath {
        look(at: the.clouds).long(enough,
             to: forget(you, ever: existed))
        
    } catch some.space {
        notice(the.hidden.symmetry, of: trees)
        
    } catch some.forgiveness {
        dream(of: shedding(yourself))
                 .like(snakes.shed.their.skin)
    }

    then { go(.back, to: the.city) }

    smell
    --- mundane.but.sheltered
        --- dull.but.familiar
            --- blue.but.home
