    I.came(across: threeWitches)
    They.offered(me)(threeWishes)

    I.said { sweet!
        threeWitches
        .here(come: my.threeWishes) {

            Nourish(me, to: fullness)
            Nurture(me, to: sleep)
            Boil(me, to: death)
        }
    }

    And { they.did()
    Now(all: that is left)
    Is(banging(the: lid)) }
