       squint(your: eyes)
       all(you: see)
          .map(unease)
          .reduce(to, darkness)

       light.comes(from: .above)
       let it = sink(beneath: your.skin)
       shadows.lay(the: path)
              .mantle(your.vulnerabilities)
       belong()
    }

    tonight is the.night
    we.expel.the.fear.from
    .isTheHeadlightOn = false
    just
       breathe
