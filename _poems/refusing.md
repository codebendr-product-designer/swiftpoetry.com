    refusing


    we.exist
    just(because:)
    we.refuse(to: believe, that: we.donʼt) {

    weʼre in love
    just(because:)
    we.refuse(to: believe, that: weʼre.not)
     
    weʼre.now
    just(because:)
    we.refuse(to: believe, we.shall(pass)) }
         
    every[day]
    you.bring(me, the: oxygen)
    I.bring (you, the: coffee)
    and { we.keep(refusing)
            .keep(refusing)
    (to: believe, thereʼs.nothing(to: bring)) }
