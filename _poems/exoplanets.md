            so: delicate,
            that: i.fear(), to: blink(), while: looking().at))

    if let you: be<another.world> = .some(world), any.world {

        i.just.wish.i(could, `let`, you).`catch`(my: breath)

        please!
            .would(you)
            .take(the: vibrations, from: the.gasps, of: delight)
            .and(the: heat, from: the.pumping, of: my.heart)
            .plus(the: liveliness, infiltrating: all.my.cells)
