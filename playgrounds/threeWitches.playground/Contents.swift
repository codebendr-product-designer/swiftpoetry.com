I.came(across: threeWitches)
They.offered(me)(threeWishes)

I.said { sweet!
    threeWitches
    .here(come: my.threeWishes) {
        
        Nourish(me, to: fullness)
        Nurture(me, to: sleep)
        Boil(me, to: death)
    }

And { they.did()
Now(all: that is left)
Is(banging(the: lid)) }
